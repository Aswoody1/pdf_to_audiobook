# PDF to Audiobook
## Overview
Take the text elements from a pdf file and convert them into an audio file using PDF readers and the google text-to-speech API.
## What I learned
* This task gave me a lot more experience reading documentation specifically with the google API and required a lot of dealing with the terminal to make sure the program had the required elements and the terminal was in the correct programming language to access the API.
